ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence, with a strong foundation in both academic research and practical software development.

Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience as a front-end web developer, building modern, responsive applications using React, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

My academic and project work extends into Machine Learning and Big Data, where Iâ€™ve worked on:

Clustering algorithms and logistic regression for data analysis

Recommendation systems using hierarchical clustering and association rules

MLOps practices with MLflow for experiment tracking and model deployment

Spark, Hadoop, and GraphFrames for large-scale data processing and graph analytics

Iâ€™m currently developing a queue simulator for my final year project and exploring automation tools like Docker and React Native for mobile development. Iâ€™ve also built an application to automatically grade exam solutions, bridging my technical and educational experience.

Beyond development, I work as a contracted professor and lecturer, with several years of experience teaching high school mathematics and consulting in education and technology.
