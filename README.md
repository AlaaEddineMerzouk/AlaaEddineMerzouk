- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alaa Eddine Merzouk
- I'm a fourth-year computer science student specializing in artificial intelligence. I have three years of experience as a front-end web developer, mainly working with React, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using technology. I've worked on projects involving machine learning, including clustering, logistic regression, recommendation systems, and I'm exploring tools like MLflow to understand MLOps architecture. Iâ€™ve also used big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark, and I'm currently working with GraphFrames for graph analysis.

In addition to my studies, Iâ€™m a contracted professor and lecturer, and I have several years of experience as a high school math teacher and consultant. I enjoy combining my technical skills with teaching and mentorship.

I'm always learning and experimenting with new technologies like Docker and React Native, and I love building practical solutions â€” like a queue simulator for my final year project, or an app that can automatically grade students' exam solutions.
